# wp-env

This is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/env) `wp-env`. This fork is created to merge PRs faster. Due to the volume of work in the Gutenberg repository sometimes it takes months to merge a PR, and that's annoying to wait for.

Do not submit PRs directly to this repository. If you want a PR that's awaiting review in Gutenberg merged, open an issue here mentioning the PR.

# Usage

Install from `npm` into your project:

`npm i -D @ribarich/wp-env`

Then use it by running `npx wp-env start`, etc. See the original package for all available commands.
