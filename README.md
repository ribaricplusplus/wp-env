# wp-env

This is a fork of `wp-env` which merges PRs faster. Due to the volume of work in the Gutenberg repository sometimes it takes months to merge a PR, and that's annoying to wait for.

Do not submit PRs directly to this repository. If you want a PR that's awaiting review in Gutenberg merged, open an issue here mentioning the PR.
